# Truly-K.github.io

## DESCRIPTION
Website introducing myself, showing my style, and describing a few projects that I have done. I have worked many hours to include every listed criteria on the grading of this assignment, and hope that works in my favor. 

## SKILLS
This website demonstrates use of JavaScript, CSS, and HTML

## HOW TO RUN
* Navigate through the website using the navigation bar.
* Each icon will link you to somewhere, whether you want to email me or check out my GitHub and LinkedIn.
* This website is responsive and functional just as a website should be.

## ROADMAP
Future improvements will include additional projects and further styling on the projects page. I will also remove bootstrap and the grid layout option, because they were very difficult to work with and limited the use of flex.â€¨
